# Public-README-Sample
This repository is an example for a good public repository README page.
One of the most crucial things in your open source project is the README.md file, make your repository look good, useful, easy to understand and use.

***Note** - There is a difference between the 'Read me' page of your public repository and the private one, according to the monetization path you've chose.
For example, if you choose the 'Dual Licens' model, you should write in your public (GPL copyleft) license repository what extra features can be found in the private MIT license at [xs:code](https://cp.xscode.com/repositories/8) and of course add a link to it,
another example, if you chose the 'Open Core - Freemium' model, you should also attach a link and  write in the public repository the maintanance and support offers for the Pro version.
